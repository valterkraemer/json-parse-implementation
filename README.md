# JSON parse implementation

Implementation for parsing JSON. Made it to learn a bit more about parsers.

This is however mostly a refactored version of the parser presented in [this article](https://lihautan.com/json-parser-with-javascript/), but written in Typescript.

## Running tests

Using [Deno](https://deno.land), run

```
deno test
```
